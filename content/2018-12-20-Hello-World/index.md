Hello World 🌎 - I would like to talk 🔈 about my self in this article. Let's start this journey together. My name is Praveen and I'm a full-stack web developer 🕸️. I have been an opensource contributor since 2018. Currently I'm a pursing my B.Tech in Computer Science.
The world of `World Wide Web` 🌐 had always fascinated me for a very long time. Ever since my only dream 🙃 was to architect real-time applications that millions of people use in real-time, for instance a 🚗 taxi booking app, a food delivery 🍔 app or some online 💵 payment app. I strongly believe the world of `Web Technology` is going to transform the world in the near future. Currently a lot of 🕸️ web apps that are built behave more like mobile 📱 app and show real-time data. In the near future the web is going to be a huge setup that will link most of the IoT devices together.

In my early teens 👦🏻 I was not a good coder 👨🏽‍💻 as such. I could hardly write a `C Program` and could not even understand many use-cases 😷 of these programs. Probably because I was not much of a book worm 🐛. Things changed in the year 2017 and my fascination towards programming increased and in the year 2018 I started programming the `Web`. Today I'm a full-stack web developer 👨🏽‍💻 working with multiple technologies. Currently I work with mostly `Javascript` tech stacks like `ReactJS` and `NodeJS`. I'm open to discussions on various Javascript technologies. I will try to update my blog as much as possible so that many of you can get an idea of the latest trends in technologies.
